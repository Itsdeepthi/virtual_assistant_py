# virtual_assistant_py
I created a virtual assistant that aids with simple tasks using python
My virtual assistant recognises the voice of a person and do the task
This assistant can do tasks like playing songs on youtube, open google,tell a joke, let the person know of the present time and date
It can also search in web and get back to tell you of its contents. It can also send a mail
